# Hi! I’m Gaetano Carbone

I am a Computer Engineering student specializing in **Embedded Systems**. I recently completed my Bachelor’s degree and I’m genuinely passionate about how hardware and software talk to each other. I like building things that work, whether they live in a microcontroller or on a desktop.

### Project Overview & Quick Links

#### [Algorithms & Logic]

Small implementations and exercises focused on understanding various algorithms.

* **[Word Predictor](https://github.com/gwetano/word-predictor):** A Java-based engine using Markov chains to predict the next word in a sequence.
* **[Simple 1-NN](https://github.com/gwetano/NearestNeighbor):** A minimal, 100-line implementation of a 1-Nearest Neighbor classifier.

#### [Personal Utilities]

Tools I built because I needed them to work better.

* **[mark](https://github.com/gwetano/mark):** A Markdown editor designed for my personal note-taking workflow.
* **[slash](https://github.com/gwetano/slash):** A minimal Electron-based floating search bar for quick commands, calculations, and web searches.

#### [Academic Explorations]

A collection of projects developed during my university path

### Hardware & 3D Design

I use 3D modeling to complement my engineering projects. It’s about making the hardware functional and portable.

* **[Arduino Nano Magnetic Case](https://github.com/gwetano/MagneticCaseArduinoNano):** A custom-designed enclosure with integrated magnets for easy mounting.
* **[Apple Watch Pocket Case](https://github.com/gwetano/apple-watch-pocket-case):** A 3D-printed housing designed to use the Apple Watch as a pocket device.
